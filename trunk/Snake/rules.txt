Snake (video game)

Snake is a video game that came out in the late 1970s and has maintained popularity since then, becoming somewhat of a classic. The player controls a long, thin creature, resembling a snake, which roams around on a bordered plane, picking up food (or some other item), trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the "walls" that surround the playing area. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult. The user controls the direction of the snake's head (up, down, left, or right), and the snake's body follows. The player cannot stop the snake from moving while the game is in progress.

History

The Snake variety of games originated with the arcade game Blockade, released by Gremlin in 1976. [1] The first known microcomputer version of Snake, titled 'Worm', was programmed in 1978 by P. Trefonas (USA) on the TRS-80 computer, and published by CLOAD magazine the same year. This was followed shortly afterwards with versions from the same author for the PET and Apple II computers. A microcomputer port of Hustle was first written by P. Trefonas in 1979 and published by CLOAD magazine [2]. This was later released by Milton Bradley for the TI-99/4A in 1980. [3]

Some better-known versions include the Neopets example, which is known as "Meerca Chase". Its revised version is known as "Meerca Chase II". A popular variant called Nibbles was also included with MS-DOS for a period of time.
